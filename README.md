# Next.js 15: Handling Non-Existent Routes and Files

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications where attempting to access a non-existent route or file results in unexpected behavior.  The error might not be clearly indicated, leading to troubleshooting challenges.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from trying to import or render a component or file that doesn't exist. Instead of a clear error message, the application might display a blank page or a generic server error, making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling and validation to gracefully handle cases where referenced files or routes are missing. This might involve utilizing try-catch blocks or implementing custom error pages for a better user experience.
